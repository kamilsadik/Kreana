# Creator Token Exchange

## Overview

Creator Token Exchange allows a creator to mint an original token to sell to their fans. The Creator Token Exchange relies on a Dynamic Automated Market Maker (explained below) to generate revenue for the creator as more tokens are minted, while providing continuous and perpetual liquidity for buyers of the token.

### Motivation

Why we need a dynamic automated market maker (with sale price function that is both distinct from buy price function, and dynamic)

### Mechanism

Depiction of buy/sale price functions

### Computation

Derivation of breakpoint, demonstrating how we can construct a sale price funtion for any buy price function (s.t certain constraints)

## Use Case

### Creator Tokens

### Alternative Uses

#### Proprietary platform (e.g., fantasy football, other platform where the platform itself would keep crystallized revenue)
